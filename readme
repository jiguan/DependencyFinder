Description: 
This function is to find out the closure of each functional dependency 
(The closure of F in R (denoted F+) is the set of all FDâ€™s in that are logically implied by F, wiki)

Time complexity: O(n^2). 
Worst case: 
For the case:
A-> B C D E
B-> C D E
C-> D E
D-> E
If the program starts from A to D. It will go over every node twice at most. For example, when the program analyzes the B node, it cannot burrow the result from A node. 

Possible way to improve the time complexity:
1. First find out the node depends on nothing. Here is E. Push E->null into new dependency map
2. Find out the node who ONLY depends on the nodes we have explored, here is D. push it to the map.
3. Repeat step 2. Until we visit all node. 

However, this method has too many situations to be considered.
